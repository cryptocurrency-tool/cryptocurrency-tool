‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimer:** [Your Tool Name] is a tool for research and education.  It is **not intended** for unauthorized access or any malicious activities. Use it ethically, responsibly, and only with wallets that you own or have explicit permission to access.

## How It Works - Unveiling the Crypto Secrets

[Your Tool Name] generates and analyzes wallets using widely-accepted standards: it employs [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin wallet creation, as well as [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based blockchains such as Ethereum.

The software generates potential addresses, and then compares them with known address databases or uses real-time balance checks through blockchain explorers. It's built in C++ and open-source, allowing for transparency and customization.

## Why [Your Tool Name]? Discover the Difference

Unlike many tools, **[Your Tool Name]** is built in C++ and optimized to make the most of multi-threaded CPU and GPU power, delivering up to **10x faster** performance.

## Wallet Discovery: How to Search for Lost Wallets

**[Your Tool Name]** allows you to use a brute-force method to search for wallets with balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Searching:

*   Method 1: Use the program menu, or use `start_search_btc.bat`, which uses online checks.
*   Method 2: Use the database. This process is much faster, as the balance is already known.

### EVM Wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Method 1: Utilize the menu, or `start_search_evm.bat` to check via blockchain explorers.
*   Method 2: Use the database. This approach is significantly faster.

### Performance Considerations:

*   The speed of the search is strongly related to your hardware, especially your GPU. Consider running multiple instances of the program (1-4, depending on your system) for faster results.
*   The database significantly boosts the efficiency of your search.

## Found a Wallet? What Are the Next Steps?

If the program locates a wallet with a balance:

*   The process will **stop immediately**.
*   The wallet's details will be **displayed** in the console.
*   The data will be **saved** in the file named ``found_wallets.txt``.

### Accessing the Funds:

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You will then be able to transfer your found funds.

## Bitcoin Wallet Recovery: Guide

[Your Tool Name] provides functionality to recover your Bitcoin wallet by its seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).  It supports both the full seed phrase and searches for missing words using special characters.

### Procedure Description

#### Searching with missing words:

If your seed phrase has missing or unknown words, represent these with an *. [Your Tool Name] will search all possible combinations of words.

#### Entering the complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed phrase, separated by spaces.

![recovery](/shared/current.webp)

### Important Recommendations

*   The seed phrase *must* contain precisely 12 words.
*   Use * only to mark missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   When a wallet is recovered the program stops and saves the info.
